# ZERO_GPU_RNE_hackthaon

## Project Overview
This repository contains two main components developed for the ZERO_GPU team : 

### Anonymisation
The anonymisation folder contains tools and algorithms designed to remove or obscure personally identifiable information (PII) from datasets. This component ensures data privacy compliance while maintaining data utility for analysis and model training.

Key features:
- Text anonymization techniques
- Personal data obfuscation
- Privacy-preserving data transformations

### Speech-to-Text
The speech_to_text folder implements efficient speech recognition capabilities without requiring GPU resources. This component focuses on converting audio inputs to text with high accuracy while optimizing for CPU-only environments.

Key features:
- Lightweight speech recognition models
- Optimized inference for CPU environments
- Support for multiple audio formats

## Getting Started
See the individual README files within each folder for specific installation instructions and usage examples.
